    <p>These are my learnings from trying to solve Eternity II.
Needless the say, none of these strategies resulted in a solution so far.</p>

<h2>Short-distance effects</h2>
<p>Due to the design of the base pieces, placing one 2x2 piece has almost no effect on the neighboring locations.
The immediate neighbour locations could loose a few two-side options, but beyond that there is typically no effect at all.
The bigger evaluators (3x3 and 4x4) are needed to find an effect.</p>

<p>Once the puzzle has more locations filled, the problems typically occur at a random location further away from the last placed piece, due to the used base pieces.</p>

<h2>Location tension</h2>
<p>Once the neighbors of a location get filled, the location comes “under tension”.
With this I mean the chance of finding a solution is decreasing.</p>

<p>One neighbor is not too bad, two sides is tension, three or four sides means a very small chance of a solution.</p>

<h2>Constraints</h2>
<p>I noticed the puzzle contains “constraints” in the form of rings.</p>

<p>If we attempt to create a complete outer ring, then it is easy until the very end: the last piece cannot be placed.
This is the constraint that cannot be fulfilled.</p>

<p>In addition, when the ring is complete there could be tension on the inner corners and we typically find there is no solution left.</p>

<p>Specialized ring generators were written to create a valid ring, as a good foundation for solving the remainder.</p>

<h2>Solving outside-in</h2>
<p>Starting with a solid ring1, it is an option to solve from the outside towards the center.
This means the tension of the border is solved.
Unfortunately, a lot of borders can be made with varying utilization of inner base pieces.</p>

<p>More details: <a href="/e2solver23/background/2024/01/01/31-ring1-generator">ring1 generator</a></p>

<h2>Solving from in between</h2>
<p>Starting with a solid ring2, four of the hints are already placed properly.
The challenge is to find an outer border.</p>

<h2>Solving inside-out</h2>
<p>Starting with a solid ring3, it is an option to solve from the inside towards the border.
The advantage is that the center hint is secured.</p>

<p><img src="/e2solver23/assets/ring3.png" alt="Ring3" width="70%" /></p>

<p>The rings all come with the problem of location tension described above: the inside corners have two sides that need to match
and at least once the three-side tension happens when closing the next ring.</p>

<h2>Lines</h2>
<p>Using horizontal or vertical lines it is possible to limit the location tension to two sides.
But the constraints of the rings are solved very late.</p>

<p>Very likely this is how the puzzle was created - see the page on <a href="/e2solver23/background/2024/01/01/98-wang-tiles">Wang Tiles</a>.</p>
