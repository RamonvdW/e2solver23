    <p>The ring1 generator creates a closed ring of 2x2 pieces along the outer border.
It starts with a border consisting of base pieces, then finds compatible 2x2 pieces.
It also verifies that all inner corners can be solved: it requires a valid 2x2 pieces (with unused base pieces) plus two direct neighbours.</p>

<h2>Generating an outer border</h2>
<p>Efficiently generating a border is a challenge by itself.
One optimization is using lists of pre-calculated corners with two border pieces on each side: border, border, corner, border, border.
The pre-calculated lists are checked for being able to make a valid solution with the hint piece. 
In the top-left corner, the 4 corner pieces can be coupled to four border pieces in 2600 ways.
The top-right corner can be made in 3400 ways.</p>

<p>A seed number provided by the operator allows to vary the starting position for the generator.
This allows generating controlled variations while being able to re-generation the same solution when needed.</p>

<p>The method used is to shuffle the pre-calculated lists by repeatedly removing one element and appending it to the end.
The number of shuffles depends on the length of the array: 10, 1000 or 10000.</p>

<p>The seed initializes a pseudo-random generator.
The numbers it generates are indexes into the array, for the shuffle.</p>

<p>Once the shuffle is done, the border generator searches for complete borders and outputs these.
It is possible to try the border generator with a management command:</p>
