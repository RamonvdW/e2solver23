For monitoring purposes, the evaluators use a database record to report what they are doing.
The website picks up this information and displays it to the user.

In the example below, several 3x3 evaluators are checking the remaining options for 12 segments of the 3x3.

The first evaluator is considering locations 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, 23.
It is currently evaluating the 5th segment (marked in bold), checking option 78 out of 80.

We can also see that none of the evaluators are stuck because all are continuously reporting out.
