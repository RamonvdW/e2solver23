For monitoring purposes, the evaluators use a database record to report what they are doing.
The website picks this information up and shows it to the user.

In the example below, 13 evaluators are searching for solutions to confirm/deny each option of 12 segments of their 3x3.
The first evaluator is considering locations 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, 23.
It is currently evaluating the 5th segment of 12 (marked in bold), checking option 78 out of 80.

Finally, we can see that none of the evaluators are stuck because all are continuously reporting out.
