Once the number of options goes down, several locations start to "claim" base pieces: there is simply no solution possible unless the location can use that base piece.
The solver tracks these claims in the database and uses the information when considering the remaining 2x2 pieces possible for a location.

The following management command evaluates the claims and updates the database.

{% endhighlight %}

In the above output we can read:
- 8 base pieces are claimed for specific locations
- Several locations on the board show "tension": only 2 or 3 base pieces left to chose from
- 4 location needs the same set of 4 base pieces (the four corners)

The information of single-location-use and dual-location-use claims is applied automatically in the evaluators.
The remainder of the information can be used when solving manually.

<h2>Automatic update of claims</h2>
The eval_claims command tracks how many two-side options were remaining at the time of evaluation.
When the number has dropped 5% below that level, the evaluators automatically schedule a new claims evaluation.

This ensures that the claims are updated regularly.
