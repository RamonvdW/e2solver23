Suggestions for improving the solver:
- What can we conclude when reaching a dead end?
- Reduce the amount of steps and CPU cycles needed to conclude that a Ring3 is a non-solution
    - Is it necessary to reduce the TwoSideOptions before splitting the board?
    - Do the board split + fix a location in memory?
