Increasing the size of the pieces reduces the number of locations on the board.
Instead of a 16x16 board we now “only” have to deal with an 8x8 board.

I numbered the locations on the board 1 to 64, as shown below.
The hints have ended up in locations 10, 15, 36, 50 and 55.

The image below is used for visualizing the board on the live website.
The thick grey bars between the cells will be filled with information about the progress.
