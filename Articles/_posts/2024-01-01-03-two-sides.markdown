The 2x2 pieces have four "big sides" that I simply numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 starting at the top, going clockwise.

Each two-side consists of the two sides of the base piece that ended up pointing in that direction.

The base piece colors must be put in a specific order into the two-side.
The order is left-to-right for sides 1 and 3 and top-down for sides 2 and 4.

The way the puzzle pieces fit together into the 2x2 pieces resulted in 460 "two sides":
- combination of two of the 17 inner colors: 17x17=289
- combination of the 5 border colors + the 17 inner colors: 5x17=85 and 17x5=85
- combination of two outside borders: 1

The database contains a table with these 460 rows: a number and the two actual colors.
The 2x2 pieces refer to these numbers only.

Searching for 2x2 pieces that fit together means asking the database for pieces with a matching side:

{% highlight text %}
qset = Piece2x2.objects.filter(side1=piece_above.side3)
{% endhighlight %}
