The board is organized in 137 "segments" for which the remaining [two sides](/background/2024/01/01/03-sides) are tracked.

The segments are numbered according to the location number:
- Above = location
- Below = location + 8
- Left = 100 + location
- Right = 100 + location + 1

The columns on the far left and right have the same segment number.
Since these hold the same 1 remaining option, it was an acceptable side-effect.

8x8 (columns) + 8x8 (rows) + 8 (bottom row) + 1 (right of 64) = 64+64+8+1 = 137 segments.
